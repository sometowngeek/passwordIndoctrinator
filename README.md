Have a hard-to-remember password, or did an organization force you to change your password? This app will help you indoctrinate the password in your memory.

Sure, there are password managers, but there are some passwords you might need to use repeatedly. Use this app to help memorize the password.

This app will have you type the password you want to memorize and once you start, you need to type it accurately 10 times in a row before it stops.
